# Cohabs Code Challenge

Welcome in our Code challenge, the goal of this exercices if to have an idea about your skill, but above all, to have a basis for discussions during our debriefing. This test does not need to be perfect, so there is no need to spend weeks finalizing it, a simple functional example and a good argument will be more than enough.

# Getting Started:

1) Fork the into your workspace.

2) Clone it your local machine.

3) Do the exercise and push it into your repository.

4) When is done share with us the link to the repository.
