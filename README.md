# Cohabs Code Challenge

Welcome in our Code challenge, the goal of this exercices if to have an idea about your skill, but above all, to have a basis for discussions during our debriefing. This test does not need to be perfect, so there is no need to spend weeks finalizing it, a simple functional example and a good argument will be more than enough.
